- 👋 Hi, I’m @alinsson
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded software development
- 🌱 I’m currently develops credit analysis for banco BV (Votorantim Bank)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python software development
- 📫 How to reach me: alinssonf@gmail.com
- I was dba, now i'm a senior full stack python developer, but I love C, C++, C# and Java. Backend is my strong point, from development to deploy. Docker, api rest and sql is a plus.
